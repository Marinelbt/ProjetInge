Title: 2-Dimensional Bradley-Terry Modeling of Paired Comparison Data
Version: 1.0
Author: D. Causeur and F. Husson

Description: Analyzing paired comparison
        data by a 2D extension of the usual Bradley-Terry model. This
        model is especially useful to detect violation of linearity in
        the basic Bradley-Terry model, which can be due to intransitive
        patterns such as "A is better than B", "B is better than C" but
        "C is better than A".
